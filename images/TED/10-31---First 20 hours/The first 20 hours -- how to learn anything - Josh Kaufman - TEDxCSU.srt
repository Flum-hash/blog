翻译人员: Hong Li
校对人员: Rongxin Liu

2
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:11,065
大家好

3
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:16,625
两年前，我的生活完全改变了。

4
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,261
我和我的太太凯尔希

5
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:23,033
迎来了我们的女儿莱拉。

6
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:27,456
为人父母是一种奇妙的体验。

7
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:30,704
一夜之间，一切都改变了。

8
00:00:30,704 --> 00:00:33,285
你所有的计划全部被打乱。

9
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:39,294
速度之快，让人措手不及。

10
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:43,547
然后你会有很多东西要学。

11
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:46,820
比如，该如何打扮你的宝宝。

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,954
（笑声）

13
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:50,091
对我而言这是新的挑战。

14
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,844
这是我搭配的一套，
我觉得还挺不错的。

15
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:59,558
但是好像连莱拉都看不上。
（笑声）

16
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:04,409
要学的还很多，千头万绪的。

17
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,533
更糟的是，凯尔希和我都在家工作，

18
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:11,223
我俩都做生意，有自己的公司。

19
00:01:11,223 --> 00:01:16,992
凯尔希为瑜伽教练做在线课程开发。

20
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:18,333
我是一名作家。

21
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,782
因此，我俩都在家上班。

22
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:23,901
我们有婴儿要照顾，我们竭尽全力

23
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:26,725
把每件事都做好。

24
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:31,107
日子过得非常忙碌。

25
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:36,718
这种奇妙的体验持续几周过后，

26
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:40,247
睡眠不足的弊端开始显现，

27
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:42,299
大概是在第八周的时候，

28
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,732
我产生了一种想法，我觉得这种想法

29
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:49,773
无论你是哪国人，无论你多大年龄，

30
00:01:49,773 --> 00:01:52,467
只要你当父母了，都会有：

31
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:58,054
我此生再无自由之日了。

32
00:01:58,054 --> 00:01:59,183
（笑声）

33
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:02,403
有人说确实如此。

34
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:05,214
这可能有点绝对，

35
00:02:05,214 --> 00:02:09,866
但在当时的情境下，我真的是这么想的。

36
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:12,063
这让我很抓狂，

37
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:15,473
因为我最喜欢的事情

38
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:19,428
就是学习新事物。

39
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:22,261
对某件事产生兴趣，然后一头扎进去，

40
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:25,164
不断尝试，不断学习。

41
00:02:25,164 --> 00:02:28,440
最后变得比较擅长。

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,336
但是，如果没有自由支配的时间，

43
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:36,405
我真不知该如何继续我的这个爱好。

44
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:38,877
没错，我是个死宅，

45
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:42,070
我想持续学习，不断成长。

46
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,087
于是我做出一个决定，

47
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:47,784
去图书馆和书店

48
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:49,922
寻找研究资料，

49
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:53,523
看我们该如何学习，如何快速学习。

50
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:56,834
我读了很多书，也浏览了不少网站。

51
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,091
想搞清楚一个问题，

52
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:03,040
掌握一项新的技能需要多久？

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,117
知道我找到的答案是什么吗？

54
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:09,438
1万小时！

55
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:11,200
你们听过这说法吗？

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,134
要花1万小时。
如果你想学点新东西，

57
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:15,574
并且变得很擅长，

58
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,934
要用掉你1万小时的时间。

59
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:21,455
我在书本上，网站上不停地读到这一点。

60
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:28,421
我的内心是崩溃的，我的心在呐喊：

61
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,799
不！

62
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,539
我没有这么多时间！我上哪儿找1万小时？

63
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:39,088
我再也学不会新东西了。

64
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:42,421
永远没戏了。
（笑声）

65
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,479
但事实不是这样的。

66
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,559
1万小时是什么概念，打个比方，

67
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:52,422
1万小时相当于5年的全职工作。

68
00:03:52,422 --> 00:03:54,008
那是一段很长的时间。

69
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:56,364
我们都学过新东西，

70
00:03:56,364 --> 00:04:00,439
但谁也没有花过那么长的时间，对吧？

71
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:03,505
那这是怎么回事呢？有点不对劲啊。

72
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:07,078
研究结果和我们的期望、我们的经验

73
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:09,416
并不相符。

74
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,993
我发现，问题在于：

75
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:19,721
1万小时定律针对的是专家。

76
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:22,228
佛罗里达州立大学有一位教授，

77
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,226
叫做K.安德斯•埃里克森。

78
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:26,725
1万小时定律是他最先提出的。

79
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:31,261
而这一定律的研究对象，是职业运动员，

80
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:35,763
世界级音乐家和象棋大师。

81
00:04:35,763 --> 00:04:40,775
都是些竞争激烈的领域，
他们又是其中的佼佼者。

82
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:42,491
他试图弄清楚，

83
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:46,811
在这些领域，登上巅峰需要多久。

84
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:49,668
他发现，练习得越多，

85
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:52,194
在各自的领域

86
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:55,304
花费的时间越多，

87
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:57,246
最后取得的成绩就越大。

88
00:04:57,246 --> 00:05:00,165
那些站在最巅峰的人

89
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:05,101
都花了差不多1万小时来练习。

90
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:09,442
这事儿其实就是个以讹传讹的故事。

91
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,236
事情是这样的：

92
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:13,458
有一个作家叫马尔科姆•格拉德威尔

93
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,901
在2007年写了本书叫《异类：成功秘诀》，

94
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,592
核心内容就是1万小时定律。

95
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:25,642
多练习，好好练习，你就能成功，

96
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:27,367
成为本领域的佼佼者。

97
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,472
其实，埃里克森博士

98
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:32,455
真正想说的是，

99
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:37,425
要想在一个竞争非常激烈的特定领域里

100
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:41,857
成为佼佼者，需要花费1万小时的时间。

101
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:45,294
但《异类》这本书一经出版，

102
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:47,449
就迅速冲上了畅销榜首，

103
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,056
并保持了整整3个月。

104
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:54,171
1万小时定律一夜之间家喻户晓。

105
00:05:54,171 --> 00:06:00,022
全民开始以讹传讹。

106
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:04,955
“在竞争激烈的领域
登顶需要1万小时”这条信息，

107
00:06:04,955 --> 00:06:09,927
变成了“精通某件事需要1万小时”，

108
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:11,366
之后变成了，

109
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:15,667
“想要擅长某事，需要花1万小时”，

110
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,192
之后变成了，

111
00:06:17,192 --> 00:06:21,455
“学习一个新东西需要花1万小时”。

112
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:25,337
但最后这条结论：
学习一个新东西需要花1万小时，

113
00:06:25,337 --> 00:06:28,600
是不对的，大错特错。

114
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,346
实际上，这项研究说的是——

115
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:36,217
我在科罗拉多州立大学图书馆

116
00:06:36,217 --> 00:06:39,523
认知心理学区域查了很多资料，
因为我是死宅嘛。

117
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:44,216
当你在查找关于习得技能的研究成果时，

118
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:48,039
你经常会看到这张图。

119
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,694
研究者们，无论他们研究的是运动技能，

120
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:54,328
也就偏体力的（技能），还是偏脑力的技能，

121
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:57,174
他们都喜欢用可以计时的事情为例。

122
00:06:57,174 --> 00:06:59,185
因为可以量化计算，对吧？

123
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,452
于是，他们给研究参与者一个小任务，

124
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:04,156
有些需要体力解决，

125
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:08,925
有些需要动点脑筋，

126
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:13,357
他们来统计参与者需要多长时间完成。

127
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:16,095
这个图说明，刚开始的时候——

128
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:20,398
研究者给参与者的任务，
需要很长时间才能完成，

129
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,053
因为以前没做过，他们心里又没底。

130
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:26,651
但经过一段时间练习后，他们会越做越好。

131
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:30,632
早期的练习真的非常非常有效。

132
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:36,021
人只需要一点点练习，
就可以把事情做得不错。

133
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:39,663
有一点很有意思，

134
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:42,869
对于那些我们真心想学的技能，

135
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:45,736
我们就不会在乎花多少时间，对吧？

136
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:49,283
我们只在乎能学得多好，
无论这个好的标准是什么。

137
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:54,943
如果我们把练习时间换成擅长程度，

138
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:59,346
图表就倒过来了，就成为了那条著名的

139
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,274
学习曲线。

140
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,852
学习曲线告诉我们，作为初学者，

141
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:06,777
我们都极烂，而且我们也知道自己极烂。

142
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,325
（笑声）

143
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:11,997
只要一点练习，你很快就会做得很好。

144
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:15,715
因此早期的进步是非常大的。

145
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:18,630
之后在一个特定时间点，你进入了平台期，

146
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,960
之后进步就越来愈难，

147
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,659
要花更多的时间。

148
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:28,620
我想了解的就是那个，对吧？

149
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,605
从一开始学，水平极差

150
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:35,265
到比较入门，

151
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,575
需要多长时间？

152
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:42,328
理想状态，当然是越短越好。

153
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:44,539
那么，到底需要多久呢？

154
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:49,518
我的研究结果是：20小时。

155
00:08:49,518 --> 00:08:53,163
没错。你可以从什么都不懂的菜鸟，

156
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:55,739
到学会任何一种技能。

157
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:59,175
想学一门外语？想学会画画？

158
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:02,294
想学会怎么耍电锯？

159
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:03,320
（笑声）

160
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,532
如果你拿出20个小时，全情投入一件事情，

161
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:10,964
你会感到震惊的。

162
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:14,135
震惊于自己居然能这么厉害。

163
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:15,645
20个小时并不多，

164
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:19,956
也就是每天45分钟，坚持1个月。

165
00:09:19,956 --> 00:09:22,066
中间空出几天也没关系。

166
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:25,221
积累20个小时并不难。

167
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:28,100
下面是具体办法。

168
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,097
并不是说你瞎玩20个小时，

169
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:33,044
就能精通某件事。

170
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:35,713
还是要用恰当的方法进行练习。

171
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:37,417
要练习得有效率，

172
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:41,051
这才能保证你投入的20个小时

173
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:43,442
是最有效的。

174
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:47,518
下面就来介绍方法，它适用于任何事情：

175
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:51,363
首先将你想学的技能进行分解。

176
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:56,262
想好你最后要达成什么效果，

177
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:02,072
然后将技能分解成一个个小的部分。

178
00:10:02,072 --> 00:10:06,042
绝大部分我们称之为技能的事情

179
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:10,639
实际上是由许多不同的技能组成的。

180
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,211
你把技能分解得越细，

181
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:16,163
你就越能决定，

182
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:18,974
这项技能里面的哪些部分

183
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:21,365
能帮我达成目标。

184
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:23,758
你就可以先练习这些。

185
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:25,960
如果你先练习最重要的事情，

186
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,251
你就可以在最短的时间内

187
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:30,522
最大限度地提高自己。

188
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:34,273
第二点，要有一定的（理论）学习，
能帮你自我纠错。

189
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:38,467
要找3到5种学习资源。

190
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:43,719
可以是书，可以是DVD，
可以是课程，什么都行。

191
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:48,950
但是不要因为这个而推迟练习。

192
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,585
我就这么干过。

193
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:52,661
买了20本相关的书籍，说

194
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:55,138
“我要先看完这20本书，

195
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,615
然后开始学习编程。”

196
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,094
这样不对。这就是拖延。

197
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:04,141
（理论）学习不用太多，

198
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:05,850
能支撑你开始练习就可以了

199
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,914
并在练习过程中
自我纠错，自我调整。

200
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:13,819
因此（理论）学习能帮你进步，

201
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:16,724
能在你犯错时提醒你

202
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:19,630
然后进行调整。

203
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:24,106
第三点，是要排除干扰。

204
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:26,550
电视，网络，所有的干扰。

205
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,929
这些东西都会阻止你

206
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:33,308
坐下来开始练习。

207
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:36,689
你的毅力越大，

208
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:39,887
越能排除干扰，

209
00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:46,270
你就越能坐下来，认真练习，不是吗？

210
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:51,473
第四点就是要练习至少20小时。

211
00:11:51,473 --> 00:11:54,770
我觉得，（学习）大部分技能
都存在“沮丧障碍”。

212
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,078
就是“我很菜鸟而且我自己知道”的阶段。

213
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,374
真的很不爽。
谁也不愿意觉得自己蠢。

214
00:12:02,374 --> 00:12:07,314
而觉得自己蠢真的会
阻止我们坐下来安心练习。

215
00:12:07,314 --> 00:12:11,762
所以，无论你想做什么，
先给自己定个目标

216
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:14,338
先练习个20小时，

217
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:18,918
你就能渡过最初那段很受挫的时期

218
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:23,029
从而（有信心）将练习持续下去，
直到获得回报。

219
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,368
就是这样！并不复杂。

220
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:30,479
学习任何东西都可以按这四步来。

221
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:35,302
好的，理论说起来总是很容易，

222
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:37,703
其实说到练习会更加有意思。

223
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:41,964
有件乐器我想学已经很久了，

224
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:44,163
就是尤克里里琴。

225
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,787
你们看没看过杰克•岛袋的TED演讲

226
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:50,901
他弹奏尤克里里，那声音简直——

227
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,260
他就像尤克里里之神。

228
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,026
非常精彩。

229
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:57,206
我看了之后觉得，“哇，太酷了！”

230
00:12:57,206 --> 00:13:01,373
非常精妙的一种乐器。我非常想学。

231
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:03,960
于是我决定验证一下我的理论

232
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,636
花20小时来练习尤克里里

233
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:09,819
看效果如何。

234
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:13,635
演奏尤克里里的第一件事，

235
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:17,701
想要演奏，你先得有一把琴，对吧？

236
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:22,191
于是，我弄了一把尤克里里，
有请我可爱的助理。

237
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:24,526
（笑声）

238
00:13:24,526 --> 00:13:29,973
谢谢你，先生。
我想我还需要一根弦。

239
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,569
这可不是普通的尤克里里，
是插电的。（笑声）

240
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:37,204
酷吧？

241
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:45,195
最开始的几个小时
就像其他所有事情一样。

242
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:48,554
你要把所需的工具准备好。

243
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:50,616
确保它们能正常使用。

244
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:52,582
我的尤克里里最开始是没有装弦的。

245
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,548
我要搞清楚如何把它装好。

246
00:13:54,548 --> 00:13:56,515
这非常重要，对吧。

247
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:58,468
还要学习调音，准备好一切，

248
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:00,321
确保在开始练习前，

249
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:04,515
一切就绪。

250
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:11,187
当一切准备就绪，正式开始练习前

251
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:15,996
我上网找了各种数据和歌本。

252
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:19,088
上面说，哦，尤克里里，
你可以弹奏不止一根弦，

253
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:20,969
可以演奏和弦，很棒，

254
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:24,242
你可以自己给自己伴奏。
（笑声）

255
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:28,356
我开始看歌本，

256
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:32,471
我还有一本尤克里里的和弦书，
里面有上百种和弦。

257
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,534
我当时就傻了，“哇，这太恐怖了。”

258
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:37,859
但是当你真正看歌本的时候，

259
00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:42,710
你会发现相同的和弦总是重复出现，对吧？

260
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,299
其实，弹尤克里里就跟做其他事一样，

261
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:49,552
有一些固定的模式，它们非常重要

262
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:52,422
你会一直用到它们。

263
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:58,420
在大部分歌曲里，你会用到4到5种和弦，

264
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,919
那就够了，就能弹出一首歌了。

265
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,993
掌握这4、5种和弦就够了，
没必要学会几百种。

266
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:06,813
在学习过程中，

267
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:11,264
我发现了一首不错的混音曲，
由许多流行歌曲组成，

268
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:16,178
来自“惊奇轴心”乐队。
（咂舌）

269
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:19,199
看来有人知道他们

270
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,418
“惊奇轴心”认为，我们可以学会

271
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:27,017
可以弹奏，过去50年几乎所有的流行歌曲，

272
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,685
只要你能掌握4种和弦，

273
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:33,062
就是G和弦、D和弦、Em和弦和C和弦。

274
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:37,931
每首流行歌曲都由这4种和弦组成。

275
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:39,401
我觉得这太酷了。

276
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:42,584
我想学会弹所有的流行歌曲。
（笑声）

277
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:45,627
于是我决定先学这一首，

278
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:49,445
然后今天跟你们分享。
准备好了吗？

279
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:51,423
（掌声）
好的。

280
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:54,733
（音乐）

281
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,104
（演唱）
一位小镇姑娘，

282
00:16:06,104 --> 00:16:08,878
居住在一个孤独世界，

283
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:14,652
她登上午夜列车，不管去向何方。

284
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:18,889
我听说你安顿下来了，
（笑声）

285
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:21,422
你遇到了一个姑娘，

286
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:25,013
你现在结婚了。

287
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:27,323
每一夜，在我梦里，
（笑声）

288
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:30,496
我看到你，感受到你，

289
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:36,253
于是我觉得你还与我同在。
（笑声）

290
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:42,227
我不再犹豫，不再彷徨，
我不再等待，我是你的。

291
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:47,600
因为你令我惊喜，我们一起经历。

292
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,682
我会竭尽全力，
伴你走天涯。

293
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:58,244
今晚你能感受到（我的）爱吗。
（笑声）

294
00:16:58,244 --> 00:17:03,400
我无法独活，我进退两难。

295
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,460
当我发现——

296
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,489
当我身处危难，圣母玛丽亚降临，

297
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:11,865
有时候我觉得无人相伴。
没有女朋友，也不伤感。

298
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,503
没错妈妈，我肯定在做梦。

299
00:17:13,503 --> 00:17:15,835
我来自一个地下的世界。
（笑声）

300
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,863
有个快乐的流浪汉，睡在水塘旁。

301
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:22,252
嘿，我才刚认识你，简直不可思议。
（笑声）

302
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:25,712
这是我的号码，给我打电话。

303
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:30,190
哦性感的女士，
欧巴江南style。（笑声）

304
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,932
该说再见了。

305
00:17:35,932 --> 00:17:45,790
该结束了，旧的不去，新的不来。

306
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,861
（演唱和音乐结束）
（掌声）

307
00:17:56,911 --> 00:18:00,159
谢谢大家。谢谢。

308
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:06,396
我超爱这首歌。
（笑声）

309
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:10,499
告诉你们一个秘密。

310
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:14,471
当我为大家演奏完这首歌，

311
00:18:14,471 --> 00:18:19,221
我达成了练习尤克里里20小时的目标。

312
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:23,209
（掌声）
谢谢你们。

313
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:28,974
真的很神奇，几乎所有的事情，

314
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,752
只要是你想做的。

315
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:35,317
学习新事物的最大障碍并不是智力，

316
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:40,998
并不是你要去掌握很多诀窍，走捷径。

317
00:18:40,998 --> 00:18:44,753
主要的障碍是情绪上的。我们会害怕。

318
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:46,974
会觉得自己很笨，

319
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:49,275
在你学一样新东西的开始阶段，

320
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:51,537
你会觉得自己很傻。

321
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:55,633
因此，最大的障碍并不是智力，而是情绪。

322
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:58,971
投入20小时在任何事情上吧。

323
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,377
你想学什么都可以。

324
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:04,848
一门新的语言？学习烹饪？

325
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:07,114
想学画画？

326
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:10,860
什么让你兴奋，什么让你开心。

327
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,747
那你就去做什么。只需要20小时。

328
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:16,093
去享受吧。

329
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:19,060

00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:11,065
Hi everyone.

332
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:16,625
Two year ago, my life changed forever.

333
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,261
My wife Kelsey and I

334
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:23,033
welcomed our daughter Lela
into the world.

335
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:27,456
Now, becoming a parent
is an amazing experience.

336
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:30,704
Your whole world changes over night.

337
00:00:30,704 --> 00:00:33,285
And all of your priorities
change immediately.

338
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:39,294
So fast that it makes it really difficult
to process sometimes.

339
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:43,547
Now, you also have to learn
a tremendous amount about being a parent

340
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:46,820
like, for example,
how to dress your child.

341
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,954
(Laughter)

342
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:50,091
This was new to me.

343
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,844
This is an actual outfit,
I thought this was a good idea.

344
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:59,558
And even Lela knows
that it's not a good idea. (Laughter)

345
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:04,409
So there is so much to learn and
so much craziness all at once.

346
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,533
And to add to the craziness,
Kelsey and I both work from home,

347
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:11,223
we're entrepreneurs,
we run our own businesses.

348
00:01:11,223 --> 00:01:16,992
So, Kelsey develops courses
online for yoga teachers.

349
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:18,333
I'm an author.

350
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,782
And so, I'm working from home,
Kelsey's working from home.

351
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:23,901
We have an infant
and we're trying to make sure

352
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:26,725
that everything gets done
that needs done.

353
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:31,107
And life is really, really busy.

354
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:36,718
And a couple of weeks
into this amazing experience,

355
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:40,247
when the sleep deprivation
really kicked in,

356
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:42,299
like around week eight,

357
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,732
I had this thought,
and it was the same thought

358
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:49,773
that parents across the ages,
internationally,

359
00:01:49,773 --> 00:01:52,467
everybody has had this thought,
which is:

360
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:58,054
I am never going to have
free time ever again.

361
00:01:58,054 --> 00:01:59,183
(Laughter)

362
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:02,403
Somebody said it's true.

363
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:05,214
It's not exactly true,

364
00:02:05,214 --> 00:02:09,866
but it feels really, really true
in that moment.

365
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:12,075
And this was really
disconcerning to me,

366
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:15,484
because one of the things that I enjoy

367
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:19,428
more than anything else
is learning new things.

368
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:22,261
Getting curious about something
and diving in

369
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:25,164
and fiddling around and
learning through trial and error.

370
00:02:25,164 --> 00:02:28,440
And eventually becoming pretty good
at something.

371
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,336
And without this free time,

372
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:36,405
I didn't know how I was ever
going to do that ever again.

373
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:38,877
And so, I'm a big geek,

374
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:42,070
I want to keep learning things,
I want to keep growing.

375
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,087
And so what I've decided to do was,

376
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:47,784
go to the library,
and go to the bookstore,

377
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:49,922
and look at what research says about

378
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:53,523
how we learn and how we learn quickly.

379
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:56,834
And I read a bunch of books,
I read a bunch of websites.

380
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,091
And tried to answer this question,

381
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:03,040
how long does it take
to acquire a new skill?

382
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,117
You know what I found?

383
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:09,438
10,000 hours!

384
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:11,200
Anybody ever heard this?

385
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,134
It takes 10,000 hours.
If you want to learn something new,

386
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:15,574
if you want to be good at it,

387
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,934
it's going to take 10,000 hours
to get there.

388
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:21,455
And I read this in book after book,
in website after website.

389
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:28,421
And my mental experience
of reading all of this stuff was like:

390
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,799
No!!

391
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,539
I don't have time!
I don't have 10,000 hours.

392
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:39,088
I am never going to be able
to learn anything new.

393
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:42,421
Ever again.
(Laughter)

394
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,479
But that's not true.

395
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,559
So, 10,000 hours, just to give you
a rough order of magnitude,

396
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:52,422
10,000 hours is a full-time job
for five years.

397
00:03:52,422 --> 00:03:54,008
That's a long time.

398
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:56,364
And we've all had the experience
of learning something new,

399
00:03:56,364 --> 00:04:00,439
and it didn't take us anywhere
close to that amount of time, right?

400
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:03,505
So, what's up? There's something
kinda funky going on here.

401
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:07,078
What the research says and what we expect,
and have experiences,

402
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:09,416
they don't match up.

403
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,993
And what I found, here's the wrinkle:

404
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:19,721
The 10,000 hour rule came out of studies
of expert-level performance.

405
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:22,228
There's a professor
at Florida State University,

406
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,226
his name is K. Anders Ericsson.

407
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:26,725
He is the originator
of the 10,00 hour rule.

408
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:31,261
And where that came from is,
he studied professional athletes,

409
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:35,763
world class musicians,
chess grand masters.

410
00:04:35,763 --> 00:04:40,775
All of this ultra competitive folks
in ultra-high performing fields.

411
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:43,751
And he tried to figure out
how long does it take

412
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,811
to get to the top
of those kinds of fields.

413
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:49,668
And what he found is,
the more deliberate practice,

414
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:52,194
the more time
that those individuals spend

415
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:55,304
practicing the elements
of whatever it is that they do,

416
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:57,246
the more time you spend,
the better you get.

417
00:04:57,246 --> 00:05:00,165
And the folks at the tippy top
of their fields

418
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:05,101
put in around 10,000 hours of practice.

419
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:09,442
Now, we were talking about the game
of telephone a little bit earlier.

420
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,236
Here's what happened:

421
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:13,458
an author by the name
of Malcolm Gladwell

422
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,901
wrote a book in 2007 called
"Outliers: The Story of Success",

423
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,592
and the central piece of that book
was the 10,000 hour rule.

424
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:25,642
Practice a lot, practice well,
and you will do extremely well,

425
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:27,367
you will reach the top of your field.

426
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,472
So, the message,

427
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:32,455
what Dr. Ericsson was actually saying is,

428
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:37,425
it takes 10,000 hours to get
at the top of an ultra competitive field

429
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:41,857
in a very narrow subject,
that's what that means.

430
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:45,294
But here's what happened:
ever since Outliers came out,

431
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:47,449
immediately came out,
reached the top of best seller lists,

432
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,056
stayed there for three solid months.

433
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:54,171
All of a sudden the 10,000 hour rule
was everywhere.

434
00:05:54,171 --> 00:06:00,022
And a society-wide game of telephone
started to be played.

435
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:04,955
So this message, it takes 10,000 hours
to reach the top of an ultra competitive field,

436
00:06:04,955 --> 00:06:09,927
became, it takes 10,000 hours
to become an expert at something,

437
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:11,366
which became,

438
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:15,667
it takes 10,000 hours to become
good at something,

439
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,192
which became,

440
00:06:17,192 --> 00:06:21,455
it takes 10,000 hours
to learn something.

441
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:25,337
But that last statement,
it takes 10,000 hours to learn something,

442
00:06:25,337 --> 00:06:28,600
is not true.
It's not true.

443
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,346
So, what the research actually says --

444
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:36,217
I spent a lot of time here
at the CSU library

445
00:06:36,217 --> 00:06:39,523
in the cognitive psychology stacks
'cause I'm a geek.

446
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:44,216
And when you actually look
at the studies of skill acquisition,

447
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:48,039
you see over and over
a graph like this.

448
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,694
Now, researchers,
whether they're studying a motor skill,

449
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:54,328
something you do physically
or a mental skill,

450
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:57,174
they like to study things
that they can time.

451
00:06:57,174 --> 00:06:59,185
'Cause you can quantify that, right?

452
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,452
So, they'll give research participants
a little task,

453
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:04,156
something that requires
physical arrangement,

454
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:08,925
or something that requires
learning a little mental trick,

455
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:13,357
and they'll time how long a participant
takes to complete the skill.

456
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:16,095
And here's what this graph says,
when you start --

457
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:20,398
so when researchers gave participants
a task, it took them a really long time,

458
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,053
'cause it was new
and they were horrible.

459
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:26,651
With a little bit of practice,
they get better and better and better.

460
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:30,632
And that early part of practice
is really, really efficient.

461
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:36,021
People get good at things
with just a little bit of practice.

462
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:39,663
Now, what's interesting to note is that,

463
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:42,869
for skills that we want to learn
for ourselves,

464
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:45,736
we don't care so much about time,
right?

465
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:49,283
We just care about how good we are,
whatever good happens to mean.

466
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:54,943
So if we relabel performance time
to how good you are,

467
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:59,346
the graph flips, and you get
his famous and widely known,

468
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,274
this is the learning curve.

469
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,852
And the story of the learning curve
is when you start,

470
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:06,567
you're grossly incompetent
and you know it, right?

471
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,635
(Laughter)

472
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:11,997
With a little bit of practice,
you get really good, really quick.

473
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:15,715
So that early level of improvement
is really fast.

474
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:18,630
And then at a certain point
you reach a plateau,

475
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,960
and the subsequent games
become much harder to get,

476
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,659
they take more time to get.

477
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:28,620
Now, my question is,
I want that, right?

478
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,605
How long does it take
from starting something

479
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:35,265
and being grossly incompetent
and knowing it

480
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,575
to being reasonably good?

481
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:42,328
In hopefully, as short a period of time
as possible.

482
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:44,539
So, how long does that take?

483
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:49,518
Here's what my research says: 20 hours.

484
00:08:49,518 --> 00:08:53,163
That's it.
You can go from knowing nothing

485
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:55,739
about any skill that you can think of.

486
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:59,175
Want to learn a language?
Want to learn how to draw?

487
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:02,294
Want to learn how to juggle
flaming chainsaws?

488
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:03,320
(Laughter)

489
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,532
If you put 20 hours of focused
deliberate practice into that thing,

490
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:10,964
you will be astounded.

491
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:14,135
Astounded at how good you are.

492
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:15,645
20 hours is doable,

493
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:19,956
that's about 45 minutes a day
for about a month.

494
00:09:19,956 --> 00:09:22,066
Even skipping a couple days,
here and there.

495
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:25,221
20 hours isn't that hard to accumulate.

496
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:28,100
Now, there's a method to doing this.

497
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,097
Because it's not like you can just start
fiddling around for about 20 hours

498
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:33,044
and expect these massive improvements.

499
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:35,713
There's a way to practice intelligently.

500
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:37,997
There's a way to practice efficiently,

501
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:41,051
that will make sure that you invest
those 20 hours

502
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:43,592
in the most effective way
that you possibly can.

503
00:09:43,592 --> 00:09:47,518
And here's the method,
it applies to anything:

504
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:51,363
The first is to deconstruct the skill.

505
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:56,262
Decide exactly what you want
to be able to do when you're done,

506
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:02,072
and then look into the skill
and break it down into smaller pieces.

507
00:10:02,072 --> 00:10:06,042
Most of the things
that we think of as skills

508
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:10,639
are actually big bundles of skills
that require all sorts of different things.

509
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,211
The more you can break apart the skill,

510
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:16,583
the more you're able to decide,

511
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,974
what are the parts of this skill
that would actually help me

512
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:21,365
get to what I want?

513
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:23,758
And then you can practice those first.

514
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:25,960
And if you practice
the most important things first,

515
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,731
you'll be able to improve
your performance

516
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:31,502
in the least amount of time possible.

517
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:34,273
The second is, learn enough
to self correct.

518
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:38,467
So, get three to five resources
about what it is you're trying to learn.

519
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:43,719
Could be book, could be DVDs,
could be courses, could be anything.

520
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:48,950
But don't use those as a way
to procrastinate on practice.

521
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,585
I know I do this, right?

522
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:52,661
Get like 20 books about the topic,
like,

523
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:55,138
"I'm going to start learning
how to program a computer

524
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,615
when I complete these 20 books".

525
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,094
No. That's procrastination.

526
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:04,141
What you want to do
is learn just enough

527
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:05,850
that you can actually practice

528
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,914
and self correct or self edit
as you practice.

529
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:13,819
So the learning becomes
a way of getting better

530
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:16,724
at noticing
when you're making a mistake

531
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:19,630
and then doing something
a little different.

532
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:24,106
The third is to remove barriers
to practice.

533
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:26,550
Distractions, television, internet.

534
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,929
All of these things
that get in the way

535
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:33,308
of you actually sitting down
and doing the work.

536
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:36,689
And the more you're able to use
just a little bit of willpower

537
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:39,887
to remove the distractions that
are keeping you from practicing,

538
00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:46,270
the more likely you are to actually
sit down and practice, right?

539
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:51,473
And the fourth is to practice
for at least 20 hours.

540
00:11:51,473 --> 00:11:54,770
Now, most skills have what I call
a frustration barrier.

541
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,078
You know, the grossly-incompetent-
and-knowing-it part?

542
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,374
That's really, really frustrating.
We don't like to feel stupid.

543
00:12:02,374 --> 00:12:07,314
And feeling stupid is a barrier to us
actually sitting down and doing the work.

544
00:12:07,314 --> 00:12:11,762
So, by pre-committing to practicing
whatever it is that you want to do

545
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:14,378
for at least 20 hours,

546
00:12:14,378 --> 00:12:18,918
you will be able to overcome
that initial frustration barrier

547
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:23,029
and stick with the practice long enough
to actually reap the rewards.

548
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,368
That's it! It's not rocket science.

549
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:30,479
Four very simple steps that
you can use to learn anything.

550
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:35,302
Now, this is easy to talk
about in theory,

551
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:37,703
but it's more fun to talk about
in practice.

552
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:41,964
So one of the things that I've wanted
to learn how to do for a long time

553
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:44,163
is play the ukulele.

554
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,787
Has anybody seen
Jake Shimabukuro's TEDTalk

555
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:50,901
where he plays the ukulele
and makes it sound like --

556
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,260
he's like a ukulele god.

557
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,026
It's amazing.

558
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:57,206
I saw it, I was like,
"That is so cool!"

559
00:12:57,206 --> 00:13:01,373
It's such a neat instrument.
I would really like to learn how to play.

560
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:03,960
And so I decided
that to test this theory

561
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,636
I wanted to put 20 hours
into practicing ukulele

562
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:09,819
and see where it got.

563
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:13,635
And so the first thing
about playing the ukulele is,

564
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:17,701
in order to practice,
you have to have one, right?

565
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:21,791
So, I got an ukulele and
-- My lovely assistant?

566
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,526
(Laughter)

567
00:13:24,526 --> 00:13:29,973
Thank you sir.
I think I need the chord here.

568
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,569
It's not just an ukulele,
it's an electric ukulele. (Laughter)

569
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:37,204
Yeah.

570
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:45,195
So, the first couple hours are just
like the first couple hours of anything.

571
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:48,554
You have to get the tools
that you are using to practice.

572
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:50,616
You have to make sure
they're available.

573
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:52,582
My ukulele didn't come
with strings attached.

574
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,548
I had to figure out
how to put those on.

575
00:13:54,548 --> 00:13:56,515
Like, that's kind of important, right?

576
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:58,468
And learning how to tune,
learning how to make sure

577
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:00,321
that all of the things
that need to be done

578
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:04,515
in order to start practicing
get done, right?

579
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:11,187
Now, one of the things when I was
ready to actually start practicing

580
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:15,996
was I looked in online databases
and songbooks for how to play songs.

581
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:19,088
And they say, okay, ukuleles, you can
play more than one string at a time,

582
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:20,969
so you can play chords, that's cool,

583
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:24,242
you are accompanying yourself,
yay you. (Laughter)

584
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:28,356
And when I started looking at songs,

585
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:32,471
I had an ukulele chord book
that had like hundreds of chords.

586
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,534
Looking at this and
"Wow, that's intimidating".

587
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:37,859
But when you look at the actual songs,

588
00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:42,710
you see the same chords
over and over, right?

589
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,299
As it turns out, playing the ukulele
is kind of like doing anything,

590
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:49,552
There's a very small set of things
that are really important

591
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:52,422
and techniques that you'll use
all the time.

592
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:58,420
And in most songs
you'll use four, maybe five chords,

593
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,229
and that's it, that's the song.

594
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:04,993
You don't have to know hundreds,
as long as you know the four or the five.

595
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:06,813
So, while I was doing my research,

596
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:11,264
I found a wonderful little medley
of pop songs

597
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:16,178
by a band called Axis of Awesome.
(Whistles)

598
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:19,199
-- Somebody knows it. --

599
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,418
And what Axis of Awesome says
is that you can learn,

600
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:27,017
or you can play pretty much
any pop song of the past five decades,

601
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,685
if you know four chords,

602
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:33,062
and those chords are G, D, Em and C.

603
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:37,931
Four chords pump out
every pop song ever, right?

604
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:39,401
So I thought, this is cool!

605
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:42,584
I would like to play
every pop song ever. (Laughter)

606
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:45,627
So, that was the first song
I decided to learn,

607
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:49,445
and I would like to actually
share it with you. Ready?

608
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:51,423
(Applause)
Alright.

609
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:54,733
(Music)

610
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,104
(Singing)
Just a small town girl,

611
00:16:06,104 --> 00:16:08,878
living in a lonely world,

612
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:14,652
she took the midnight train
going anywhere.

613
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:18,209
I heard that you settled down,
(Laughter)

614
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:21,672
that you found a girl,

615
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:25,013
that you're married now.

616
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:27,323
Every night in my dreams
(Laughter)

617
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:30,496
I see you, I feel you,

618
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:36,253
that is how I know you go on.
(Laughter)

619
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:42,227
I won't hesitate no more, no more.
It cannot wait, I'm yours.

620
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:47,600
'Cause you were amazing,
we did amazing things.

621
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,682
If I could, then I would,
I'd go wherever you will --

622
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:58,244
Can you feel the love tonight.
(Laughter)

623
00:16:58,244 --> 00:17:03,400
I can't live with or without you.

624
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,190
When I find myself --

625
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,489
When I find myself in times of trouble,
mother Mary comes to me,

626
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:11,865
Sometimes I feel like I don't have partner.
No woman, no cry.

627
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,503
Yeah mama, this surely is a dream.

628
00:17:13,503 --> 00:17:15,835
I come from a land down under.
(Laughter)

629
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,863
Once a jolly swagman
camped by a billabong.

630
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:22,252
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy,
(Laughter)

631
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:26,412
but here's my number, so call me

632
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:30,190
Hey sexy lady, op, op, op, op,
oppan gangnam style. (Laughter)

633
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,932
It's time to say goodbye.

634
00:17:35,932 --> 00:17:45,790
Closing time, every new beginning
comes from some other beginning's end.

635
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,861
(Singing and music ends)
(Applause)

636
00:17:56,911 --> 00:18:01,199
Thank you, thank you.

637
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:06,856
I love that song.
(Laughter)

638
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:10,499
And I have a secret to share with you.

639
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:14,471
So, by playing that song for you,

640
00:18:14,471 --> 00:18:19,221
I just hit my twentieth hour
of practicing the ukulele.

641
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:23,209
(Applause)
Thank you.

642
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:28,974
And so it's amazing, pretty much
anything that you can think of,

643
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,752
what do you want to do.

644
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:35,317
The major barrier to learn
something new is not intellectual,

645
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:40,998
it's not the process of you learning
a bunch of little tips or tricks or things.

646
00:18:40,998 --> 00:18:44,753
The major barrier's emotional.
We're scared.

647
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:47,014
Feeling stupid doesn't feel good,

648
00:18:47,014 --> 00:18:49,275
in the beginning of learning
anything new

649
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:51,537
you feel really stupid.

650
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:55,633
So the major barrier's not intellectual,
it's emotional.

651
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:58,971
But put 20 hours into anything.

652
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,377
It doesn't matter.
What do you want to learn?

653
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:04,848
Do you want to learn a language?
Want to learn how to cook?

654
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:07,114
Want to learn how to draw?

655
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:10,860
What turns you on?
What lights you up?

656
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,747
Go out and do that thing.
It only takes 20 hours.

657
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:16,093
Have fun.

658
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:19,060
(Applause)
